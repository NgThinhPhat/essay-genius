As a matter of fact, with the competitive demands of companies, their labourers strive to achieve their workload effectively by tackling tasks flexibly with their own abilities. Besides that, managers base their evaluations on the final achievements of their workers instead of observing their methods. From my perspective, I suppose this approach has several advantages and disadvantages, which will be mentioned in this essay.

On the one hand, traditional employees frequently obey their managers' schedules and tasks within the established programs. They routinely perform these tasks as part of their mission to complete them as soon as possible, rather than finding optimal ways to save time, labor, and money. Additionally, most workers fear bearing full responsibility whenever they handle their tasks in their own ways, as this may lead to mistakes. Furthermore, many blue-collar workers holistically believe that they should not have to invest significantly more effort than others to receive an equal salary.

On the other hand, there are a massive number of innovative employees who handle their duties intelligently in modern society. Thanks to advancements in technology and science, both blue- and white-collar workers take advantage of these tools to replace outdated and conventional methods in order to achieve higher productivity. Of course, company leaders fully assess the value of their workers through their success, regardless of the methods they use. Last but not least, individuals who frequently tackle tough challenges smartly are more likely to be promoted and can easily secure higher positions and salaries.

In conclusion, workers can achieve significant success and gain more advantages by handling their problems with innovative methods, which are highly valued by their supervisors. This is a fundamental principle for laborers who aspire to stand out based on their ability and quality, rather than merely following traditional methods."""
